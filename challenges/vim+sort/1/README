Sort your imports out

You should use sort with vim to make the input from the 'start' file output the
same as the contents of the 'finish' file.

You should always have :wq as the last line of the solution file, as this will
save and then quit.

e.g.
echo ':.,+2s/a/b
:wq' > mysolution
vim -S mysolution start

The contents of the start file should be the same as the contents of 'finish'.

You can test this by running:
diff start finish
This will output any lines that differ.
For an alternative, you might also wish to look at 'man sdiff'.
This can be used as a drop in replacement for diff in this command.

If your command didn't work as hoped, you will need to run ./setup again to refresh
the start file.
