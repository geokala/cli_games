Sort your imports out

You should use sort with vim to make the input from the 'start' file output the
same as the contents of the 'finish' file.

e.g.
echo ':.,+2s/a/b
:wq' > mysolution
vim -S mysolution start

The contents of the start file should be the same as the contents of 'finish'.

You can test this by running:
diff start finish
This will output any lines that differ.
For an alternative, you might also wish to look at 'man sdiff'.
This can be used as a drop in replacement for diff in this command.
