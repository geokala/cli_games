That which keeps us apart

You should use cut to make the input from the 'start' file output the
same as the contents of the 'finish' file.

e.g.
echo 'cut -f2' > mysolution
cat start | ./mysolution

The output of this should be the same as the contents of 'finish'.

You can test this by running:
diff <(cat start | ./mysolution) finish
This will output any lines that differ.
For an alternative, you might also wish to look at 'man sdiff'.
This can be used as a drop in replacement for diff in this command.
