Welcome to the CLI games, a set of small challenges involving command line utilities.

It is built to work with bash and utilities commonly present on Linux systems (primarily Ubuntu).

To play, run the play command (./play) and help for the different options will be shown.

Note when listing the available challenges you will see the 'par' for each challenge- this is the amount of characters (plus a newline) in which a challenge can be reasonably completed. When you supply your solution file, this file will be tested and if it succeeds then its score (the result of 'wc -c' being run on the file) will be added to the results.

Yes, it's trivial to cheat at this- it's not intended to provide for olympic level competition, but instead to invite you to explore command line utilities that you may not have used a great deal and let you find functionality for those utilities.

Good luck!
